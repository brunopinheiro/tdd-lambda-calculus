# TDD Strategy with Lambda Calculus

Many times, I see colleagues struggling with test-driven development (TDD), especially when facing complex problems. TDD isn't just about writing tests first â€” it's also a mindset focused on:

- Defining expected behavior rather than diving into implementation details  
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces

There are plenty of great practice problems out there (like FizzBuzz), and excellent references (such as *Test-Driven Development by Example* by Kent Beck, 2002). But in my experience, these examples often donâ€™t fully capture the **strategic value** of TDD â€” specifically, how it can guide you when you're unsure how to even start solving a problem.

## Inspiration

While watching [*Fun with Lambda Calculus* by Corey Haines at GOTO 2015](https://youtu.be/QPqoFCHpLF4?si=Tqnjnfy798m_Nl-m), one part really stood out: Corey introduces a seemingly unsolvable problem, and then methodically breaks it down into approachable, simple steps. That, for me, captured the essence of TDD â€” not just as a technique, but as a **problem-solving strategy**.

## About This Repository

Iâ€™ve since used this challenge in internal technical sessions. Since I already knew the path forward, I kept the sessions interactive by offering just enough guidance when the team hit roadblocks.

This repository contains the final outcome of those sessions.  
If you're curious about the step-by-step thinking behind it, check out the commit history â€” each one tells part of the story. ðŸ˜Š
